User Members Access- Complete User Management. Manage Users, Members, Content Access, Roles, Capabilities, and add registration fields. Easy, customisable. Active support.


== Description ==

User Members Access plugin is a complete user management suite to manage users, user membership, user access rights, roles and capabilities. Create and add custom registration form fields and approve users after registration. Restrict content access by roles, simple and customisable with active support.  

Registration- Why is it mandatory?
We have made registration mandatory since many features like cloud backup, user provisioning require API integrations with our cloud service.
